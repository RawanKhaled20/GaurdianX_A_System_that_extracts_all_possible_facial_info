To be able to Use this system fisrt you have to download all the .h5 models files for the face extraction and the .plk file for sentiments analysis , also the response files as they are alamrs produced for guding you.

secondly, save all the downlaoded models files to the working directory and copy the python code in the main.py to any python IDE (I used pycharm) to run the code and make sure you pip install all the following libraries (tensorflow, opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, ultralytics, pygame, tkinter, nltk, cvzone, scikit-learn)

lastly, make sure to not open multiple tabs in the background as that will lag the system even more as it is very affected by the things running the OS
